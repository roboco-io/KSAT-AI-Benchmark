  question_text: 밑줄 친 hunting the shadow, not the substance가 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로, 가장 적절한 것은?
  passage: 'The position of the architect rose during the Roman Empire, as architecture symbolically became a particularly important political statement. Cicero classed the architect with the physician and the teacher and Vitruvius spoke of “so great a profession as this.” Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a practicing architect during the rule of Augustus Caesar, recognized that architecture requires both practical and theoretical knowledge, and he listed the disciplines he felt the aspiring architect should master: literature and writing, draftsmanship, mathematics, history, philosophy, music, medicine, law, and astronomy — a curriculum that still has much to recommend it. All of this study was necessary, he argued, because architects who have aimed at acquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority to correspond to their plans, while those who have relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously “hunting the shadow, not the substance.”'
  choices:
  - seeking abstract knowledge emphasized by architectural tradition
  - discounting the subjects necessary to achieve architectural goals
  - pursuing the ideals of architecture without the practical skills
  - prioritizing architecture’s material aspects over its artistic ones

  passage: We are famously living in the era of the attention economy, where the largest and most profitable businesses in the world are those that consume my attention. The advertising industry is literally dedicated to capturing the conscious hours of my life and selling them to someone else. It might seem magical that so many exciting and useful software systems are available to use for free, but it is now conventional wisdom that if you can’t see who is paying for something that appears to be free, then Our creative engagement with other people is mediated by AI-based recommendation systems that are designed to trap our attention through the process that Nick Seaver calls captology, keeping us attending to work sold by one company rather than another, replacing the freedom of personal exploration with algorithm-generated playlists or even algorithm-generated art.

  choices:
  - The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically.
  - Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain.
  - Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment.
  - The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the growth of locally based restaurants.
  - As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.
