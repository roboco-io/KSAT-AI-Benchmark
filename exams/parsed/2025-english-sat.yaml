  passage_text: 'The position of the architect rose during the Roman Empire, as architecture symbolically became a particularly
    important political statement. Cicero classed the architect with the physician and the teacher and Vitruvius spoke of
    “so great a profession as this.” Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, a practicing architect during the rule of Augustus Caesar, recognized
    that architecture requires both practical and theoretical knowledge, and he listed the disciplines he felt the aspiring
    architect should master: literature and writing, draftsmanship, mathematics, history, philosophy, music, medicine, law,
    and astronomy — a curriculum that still has much to recommend it. All of this study was necessary, he argued, because
    architects who have aimed at acquiring manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a position of authority
    to correspond to their plans, while those who have relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously “hunting the
    shadow, not the substance.”'

  passage_text: Think of yourself. When you decide to get up and get a drink of water, for example, you don’t consciously
    organize or consider the host of steps involved. Imagine if we ① had to consider every single muscle that needed to be
    contracted or relaxed just to stand up and walk. It would be tiresome and very slow — as patients recovering from a brain
    injury affecting the motor system ② knows. The autopilot parts of our brain do it for us automatically, ③ freeing up our
    conscious mind for more important jobs. It is the older parts of our brain ④ that support these automatic processes that
    allow us to move, hear, see, and use many of our social skills. More recently evolved abilities like talking, reading,
    and writing are far less automated. So, most of the time, ⑤ what you are perceiving, feeling, or thinking is based on
    a very crude and fast analysis that happens completely without your awareness.

  passage_text: We are famously living in the era of the attention economy, where the largest and most profitable businesses
    in the world are those that consume my attention. The advertising industry is literally dedicated to capturing the conscious
    hours of my life and selling them to someone else. It might seem magical that so many exciting and useful software systems
    are available to use for free, but it is now conventional wisdom that if you can’t see who is paying for something that
    appears to be free, then Our creative engagement with other people is mediated by AI-based recommendation systems that
    are designed to trap our attention through the process that Nick Seaver calls captology, keeping us attending to work
    sold by one company rather than another, replacing the freedom of personal exploration with algorithm-generated playlists
    or even algorithm-generated art.

  passage_text: "Hello, everyone! Recently, scientists have been paying attention to alternative food sources that could help solve future food shortages. These foods are nutritious and can be grown in various environments. For example, seaweed is rich in vitamins and minerals and can be farmed in the ocean. Beans are another great option because they are high in protein and can grow in many climates. Pumpkins are versatile and can be stored for long periods. And surprisingly, mushrooms and insects are also being considered as sustainable food sources for the future. These alternative foods could play a crucial role in feeding the growing global population."

  passage_text: "Video games have long been criticized for distracting students from their studies. However, recent research suggests that games can actually be powerful educational tools when used properly. The key is not to ban games from classrooms, but to incorporate game-like elements into learning activities. Features such as point systems, level progression, immediate feedback, and collaborative challenges can make learning more engaging and effective. Educators should develop games specifically designed to enhance learning outcomes, combining entertainment with educational content. When game mechanics are thoughtfully integrated into curriculum, they can transform passive learning into an active, immersive experience that motivates students and improves retention."

  passage_text: "The potential for market enforcement is greater when contracting parties have developed reputational capital that can be devalued when contracts are violated.\n\n(A) Similarly, a landowner can undermaintain fences, ditches, and irrigation systems. Accurate assessments of farmer and landowner behavior will be made over time, and those farmers and landowners who attempt to gain at each other's expense will find that others may refuse to deal with them in the future.\n\n(B) Over time landowners indirectly monitor farmers by observing the reported output, the general quality of the soil, and any unusual or extreme behavior. Farmer and landowner reputations act as a bond. In any growing season a farmer can reduce effort, overuse soil, or underreport the crop.\n\n(C) Farmers and landowners develop reputations for honesty, fairness, producing high yields, and consistently demonstrating that they are good at what they do. In small, close-knit farming communities, reputations are well known."

  passage_text: "(A) \"Do you remember when Sean used to tell me that I was the best dad in the world?\" Ethan asked his wife, Grace. \"Yes, I do. I always envied your relationship with Sean,\" she replied. Ethan then shared how things had changed since his son started middle school. Grace had noticed Ethan often pushing Sean to study harder. \"Maybe he isn't that into school right now. How about going hiking, just the two of you?\" she suggested. He agreed, and realizing that both his and Sean's hiking jackets were still at the laundry, he asked his wife to go and pick them up with him.\n\n(B) Ethan and Grace came back home with the jackets and checked if Sean had everything else he needed for hiking. Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks. When Sean returned from school, Ethan softly said, \"Sean, let's go hiking this Saturday, just the two of us.\" Though Sean thanked him for the suggestion, he said he had to go to the library. Grace stepped in, \"You know, the weather this weekend will be the best of the year. Why not enjoy it?\" After a moment's hesitation, he agreed.\n\n(C) \"When did you bring the jackets in?\" the clerk at the laundry asked. \"Maybe two weeks ago,\" Ethan replied. Then, Grace quickly reminded him, \"Honey, we actually left them here a month ago.\" The clerk went into the storage area to look for the clothes. Finally, he returned with the jackets and handed them to Ethan. The clerk politely said, \"I am sorry, but please collect your items earlier next time. Our storage is too full.\" Ethan felt embarrassed for the late collection and apologized.\n\n(D) The weather was perfect. Ethan and Sean set off hiking along the valley by Aicken Mountain. They walked in silence until Sean fell over a rock and twisted his ankle. Realizing he couldn't walk, Ethan carried his son down on his back. He felt Sean's heartbeat, something he hadn't felt since Sean was a baby. Suddenly, Sean said, \"Dad, I'm sorry. At some point, I started to become afraid of disappointing you. But you are still the best dad.\" Energized, he felt no weight on his back and replied, \"You are the best son, no matter what.\""

  question_text: 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
  choices:
  - The significance of the car in the development of sport and tourism generally has attracted considerable coverage and
    it has had no less an impact on sports tourism specifically.
  - Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport
    in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain.
  - Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not
    served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment.
  - The expansion of reasonably priced, good quality accommodation associated with tourism growth has also facilitated the
    growth of locally based restaurants.
  - As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require
    the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations.
